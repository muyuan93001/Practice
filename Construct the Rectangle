For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.



public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int limit = (int)Math.sqrt(area);
        int[] res = new int[]{1, area};
        for(int W= 1; W<=limit;W++){
            int L = area/W;
            if(W*L == area){
                res[0] = L;
                res[1] = W;
            }                         
        }
        return res;
    }
